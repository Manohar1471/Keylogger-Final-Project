A keylogger, also known as keystroke logging or keyboard capturing, is a type of malware or hardware that records keystrokes typed on a keyboard or device.
Keyloggers can be covert and prevent the user from knowing their actions are being monitored.
The information is then sent to a hacker who can use it to access sensitive accounts, such as those with passwords, credit card numbers, or personal messages.
